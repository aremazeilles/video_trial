= Video access Through GIT repository

The option tested are the following

* Using asciidoc (this file)
* Using markdown link:readme.md[link]
* Using markdeep link:readme_markdeep.md.html[link]

It does not seem possible to render video directly onto the Github visualisation of the pages.
But both are able to handle animated gif.
The limitation of the animated gif is that there is no way to manipulate live the video (pause /rewind)

link:https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/[Markdeep] is a tool based on markdown, which is directly rendered in most of the web browser.
The positive point is that anyone can render it onto its machine with no particular installation.
The drawback is that it is not rendered within the GitHub interface.


== Trial with asciidoc:

Video trial

video::video.mp4[Video attempt]

Done (if nothing appears, it means it does not work

Now with an animated gif:

image::video.gif[Animated gif]

Done
